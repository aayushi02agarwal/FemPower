        <p class="paragraph">Each state in the U.S gets to decide whether they want to have a sales tax and what items they want to exempt from sales tax. Generally, states place sales tax on food and prescription medications. Although food and prescription are considered necessities, other items such as menstrual items, such as tampons and pads, are not included in the except from sales tax. </p>

        <h2 class="titles"> Cultural stereotypes </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Menstruation in India is often seen as a shameful conversation. Studies estimate that 71 percent of girls have no knowledge about menstrual health until after their first period. Women are often described as “dirty” while menstruating and are commonly separated in the home when dining, praying or participating in other activities. Some studies suggest that this is due to gender norms that become more prevalent at puberty. In addition, there is no required curriculum surrounding menstrual health in school. </p>
